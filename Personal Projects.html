  <h1>Discord Bot</h1>
  
  <p>- During my community college, I used my free time to work and code a Discord bot that will do starting commands.</p> 
  <p>- Python was used to code. And yes AI was used but to only for proofreading my code and help me test.</p>
  <p>- AI helped me test my bot and setup. The Bot was also coded to access and control my Spotify account in Discord.</p>
