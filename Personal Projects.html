  <h>Discord Bot</h>
  <p>During my community college, I used my free time to work and code a Discord bot that will do starting commands. 
  Python was used to code. And yes AI was used but to only for proofreading my code and help me test.
  AI helped me test my bot and setup. The Bot was also coded to access and control my Spotify account in Discord.</p>
